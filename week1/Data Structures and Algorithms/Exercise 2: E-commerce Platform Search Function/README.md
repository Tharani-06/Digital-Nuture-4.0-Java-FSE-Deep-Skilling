Exercise 2: E-commerce Platform Search Function

Big O Notation and How It Helps in Analyzing Algorithms
  Big O notation is a mathematical way to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm in terms of the size of the input (usually denoted as n).
     It focuses on how the running time or space requirements grow as the input size increases.
     It gives an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm’s time or space usage.

Time Complexity of Linear and Binary Search
   Linear search: Checks each product one by one, so its average and worst-case time complexity is O(n).
   Binary search: Requires a sorted array and divides the search space in half each step, giving it a much faster O(log n) time complexity.

Which Algorithm is More Suitable for Your Platform and Why?
Linear search works on unsorted data but is slow for large inventories.
Binary search is much faster but needs sorted data.
For an e-commerce platform, binary search or advanced indexed searches are preferred to ensure quick results and better user experience.
