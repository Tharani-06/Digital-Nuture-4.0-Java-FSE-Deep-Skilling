Exercise 1: Inventory Management System

Why are Data Structures and Algorithms essential?

When handling large inventories, you may need to manage thousands or millions of products. Efficient data structures and algorithms help you:
   Store products efficiently
   Retrieve product information quickly
   Update stock or price instantly
   Remove out-of-stock or discontinued products fast

Chosen Data Structure: `HashMap<Integer, Product>`
  Suitable for:
    Fast search, insert, and delete by product ID
  Use when:
    You need fast access to product info
    Products are uniquely identified by ID

Time Complexity
- Add: O(1)
- Update: O(1)
- Delete: O(1)
